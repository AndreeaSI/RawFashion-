<div id="column"><h1>ABOUT</h1>
<p>Hi there! I’m Andreea and I started my tech journey about 1 year ago. The idea of getting 
  into IT was like a lightning strike to me and it made so much sense so I started learning a
  programming language. My first (and favourite!) language I dived in was JavaScript. 
  Managing to write my first blocks of code on my own, by simply watching a tutorial on 
  udemy.com, was so rewarding to me. After a long time, I finally felt creative and on the 
  right track I would say, since my day job as retail cashier did not give me anything but
  emptiness.<br><br>
  Technology incorporates so many things we surround ourselves with every day of this modern
  world and is truly improving our lives so I find this a fascinating time to join this field.<br><br>
  I do have some soft spots for other things than learning programming languages, one of them 
  would be aesthetic design or what I call signature style (a way you choose to express yourself 
  through everything you surround yourself with from fabrics to home design). It’s a territory
  where I seek for balance where style never overcomes environmental awareness. I work towards
  a more sustainable future (on a very small scale, I’m aware) and by making smarter choices I
  am limiting my personal waste, and thanks to many very talented artists who also embraced 
  this movement, I do not have to compromise my sense of styling in any way.<br><br>
  Technology can take a huge part in a sustainable development process that benefits both us and
  future generations who also deserve a close to nature living, so my goal is to build upon my 
  software programming knowledge and implement it in projects that sustain an ecologically 
  friendly environment.</p>
