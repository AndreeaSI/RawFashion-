        the world after oil production. People are becoming more and more aware of the importance of sustainability and 
        altering their consumer choices accordingly. And yet, information about the environmental impact of clothes is 
        still not easily available. For instance, when it comes to buying a pair of jeans, consumers can make choices on 
        the brand, price and style. But what if we, as consumers, also wished to consider the environmental impact of 
        producing different items of clothing? How do we know which is the greener choice?</blockquote></p>

   <div id ="column4"><h2>Fast fashion</h2><p1>The fashion industry is the second largest polluter in the world. 20% of 
       industrial water pollution stems from textiles development, fashion industry being also responsible for emitting 
       1.2 billions tonnes of greenhouse gas emmissions a year. By 2050, it is estimated that clothing production will
        account for 25% of the world carbon budget. That's more than transport and agriculture.</p1><br><br>
        <p1>The problem isn't what's available to buy, it's the throwaway culture of continuously buying new garments. 
            So, what's the cause? Fast fashion.</p1><br><img src = "conscious .jpeg" width="420" height="540"><p>H&M Conscious Collection 2019</p></div>

        is ethically sourced and uses recyled and organic materials. Their recyling initiative offers customers vouchers 
        for recyling old clothes, this initiative influences customer's behaviour of further consumptions, relying on the 
        fast fashion model, is something we may think. However, H&M can be praised for taking a step in the right direction
         beginning with their sustainable clothes and raising awareness of the worrying side effects of our shopping 
         addictions.<br><br>Inditex Group, the owner of Zara, is the largest fashion company in the world, meaning they 
         have a huge potential to reduce our environmental impacts. They've been ranked as the most sustainable fashion
          company by Dow Jones Sustainability Index. The company's goal is to develop an efficient life cycle for their 
          clothes, meaning less textile landfill waste. They begun taking steps by reusing unused textiles. Like H&M 
          Conscious, Zara have started using recycled materials and ecologically grown cotton rough the Zara Join Life 
          range, atrendy and reasonably priced collection which has significantly grown in popularity since launching in
