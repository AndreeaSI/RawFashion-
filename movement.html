<div id = "column2"><h1>A movement that goes beyond environmentalism</h1><p4>Also known as "ethical fashion" or "slow fashion", 
    sustainable fashion is a fairly new movement that's gaining more and more consumers 
    interested in diminishing their impact on environment.<br> <br>"Slow fashion" movement is gathering more and more advocates
    who happen to have a common cause - moving fashion forward.</p4>
    <br><br> <h2>6 basic principles of "Slow Fashion"</h2>
    <ul class = "no_bullet">
        <li class ="heart">need vs. want</li>
        <li class = "heart">quality vs. quantity</li>
        <li class="heart">trends vs. personal style</li>
        <li class="heart">give old clothes a new purpose</li>
        <li class = "heart">support ethical brands</li>
        <li class = "heart">be creative</li>
<br>    
<p4>When buying something meaningful, you’ll connect with it and appreciate your purchase for 
    a longer time. You’ll also feel empowered by slow fashion because it helps to develop a unique,
    personal style, and escape the allure of following commercial fashion trends.<br><br>I think 
    we can all agree that fashion trends quickly lose their initial appeal after enough of 
    people jump on the same-style bandwagon. After all, who wants to be just another face in the crowd?</p4>

    <h5>Mass-market brands are joining the movement</h5>
    <p4>Levi’s is known for being the face of denim. And the brand has always been an example of change and progress: 
        The brand adopts eco-friendly and sustainable practices like recyclable denim, ethically sourced cotton,
        and innovations to reduce water use, in addition to giving back to its workers and community organizations alike.</p4>    
    
    <p><blockquote>Fashion sells a fantasy, an idea of glamour, but there is nothing glamorous about
        exploitation. No matter how beautiful the clothes, I don’t believe a company can truly be 
        modern or relevant if they don’t take on the responsibility of ensuring adequate conditions
        for the people making the product.</blockquote></p><p>Eliana Gil Rodriguez, Creative Director of same name line of
