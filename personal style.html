 <h1>The challenges of finding your <span style = "font-family: 'Sacramento', cursive; color:#153FCA">'signature style'</span> when Fast Fashion is at its pick</h1>
<br>
<p>Fashion means so many things to so many different people, for some people fashion represents a way of improving their wellbeing, an expresion 
of their creative self or an identity that speaks a non-verbal but beautiful language, as opposed to temporary and lacking of meaning trends.<br><br>
When you are following trends you are basically wanting to look like everyone else. You buy and wear 
the same garments that are being shown in runways, publicized in magazines, and sold in the majority of stores. 
And if you want to follow those new trends every season, it can be really exhausting and expensive… not to 
mention damaging for the planet, because you will need to constantly buy and discard your clothes after a short 
while.  As a matter of fact, a recent Pulse of The Fashion Industry report stated that fashion generates 4% of 
the world’s waste each year.<br><br>On the other hand, Personal Style is unique and very personal.<br><br>Style is so much more than the season’s 
latest trends.  It’s about an attitude, a way of life, and how you share your personal story with the world. 
It is an expression of our identity and individuality.
<br>While there are many ways of self-expression, personal style is one of the easiest and more creative ways 
to do so.  When you cultivate your style, it’s like building your own unique self-brand.  You start radiating
charisma, confidence, and influence in any setting without even trying to do so.</p>
