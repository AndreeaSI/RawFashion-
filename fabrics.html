<div id = "column1"><h1>Natural fabrics</h1><h2> <img src = "cotton1.png" width="140" height = "180">Organic Cotton</h2><p>Cotton is widely used in clothing 
 apparel due to its light and breathable texture. It is one of the most preferred fabrics in hot and humid regions. This is beacause 
 cotton is highly breathable and can also aborb a good amount of sweat. There are various sustainable cottons available, 
 but, if you want to be sure what you are buying is grown in a truly sustainable way, <span style = "color: #f05151">certified organic cotton</span> is 
 the best option. Organic is the only system which eliminates highly toxic substances from the environment and instead 
 works holistically, for the long-term benefit of people and the planet.</p><h2><img src = "hempp.png" width="140" height="160">Hemp</h2><p>Hemp is a wonderfully versatile plant 
 that has been cultivated and used for hundreds of years as a fabric. The more that you wash and wear hemp fabric,
 the softer it becomes. This efficient, nutrient-rich plant is much kinder to the <span style = "color: #f05151">environment</span> 
 than many other fabrics as it requires very little water, no pesticides and naturally fertilises the soil it grows in.</p>
<h2><img src = "flax.png" width="140" height="140">Linen</h2><p>Linen is one of the most biodegradable and stylish fabrics in fashion history. It is strong, naturally
  moth resistant, and made from flax plant fibres, so when untreated (i.e. not dyed) it is fully <span style = "color: #f05151">biodegradable</span>. 
  Its natural colours include ivory, ecru, tan, and grey. Linen can withstand high temperatures—making the fabric
  generally perfect for raiding the jungle or lounging on a tropical island. It absorbs moisture without holding bacteria.
  In fact, it is actually stronger when wet than dry nd becomes softer and more pliable the more it is washed. It just gets better and better!
  <br><br><span style = "color: #f05151">Flax</span> is resilient and can grow in poor soil, using far less water in its consumption than <span style ="color: #f05151">cotton</span>. 
  According to the European Confederation of Linen and Hemp, “Across its lifecycle, a linen shirt uses 6.4 litres 
  of water” compared to 2,700 litres for a cotton shirt.</p><h2><img src = "silk.png"width="160" height="120" >Silk</h2><p>Silk has a long history as one of the most 
  luxurious fabrics in the world. The fibres that make silk are spun from the threads of a silkworm cocoon. The worms
  subsist on mulberry leaves, which are resistant to pollution and easy to cultivate. However, silk producers need
  to boil the cocoon in order to extract the fibres, killing the worms in the process. There are cruelty-free 
  options for silk-lovers – Ahimsa silk, also known as <span style = "color: #f05151">‘peace silk’</span>, allows the moth to evacuate the cocoon before
  it is boiled. Some silks that fall under the Ahimsa umbrella include ‘Eri silk’ and ‘Tussar silk’</p><br>
  <h2><img src = "sheep.png"width="130" height="90">Wool</h2><p>
  Any clothing made from wool can be a practical long-term investment for the winter months. It’s <span style = "color: #f05151">biodegradable</span> and
  if cared for correctly, a quality, timeless woollen garment will last a lifetime. As with any industry that uses 
  animals for commercial purposes however, there are ethical considerations around their treatment - mulesing - practice that involves cutting the sheep's skin.</p><br>
<h2> <img src = "bamboo.png" width="140" height="170">Bamboo</h2><p>Bamboo is marketed as a great natural alternative to cheap synthetics because it is fast growing and requires fewer pesticides than other natural fabrics.
  So when organically farmed and manufactured, bamboo fabric is an <span style = "color: #f05151">ecofriendly</span> option.</p> <img src = "bamboobriefs.png" width="320" height="460"><br><p1>KYE INTIMATES reclined brief made of 95% bamboo 5% spandax</p1>
